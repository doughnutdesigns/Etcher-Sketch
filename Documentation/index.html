				<h2><i class="fa fa-envelope-o fa-fw"></i> Email Subscription</h2>
					<hr />
					<p>The Email Subscription form with this theme can do a variety of things with the submitted addresses. It can either save them to Mailchimp lists which saves a lot of time for you and enables easier sending out of emails - or the form can save addresses to your MySQL Database or even send them to your email address. A few different steps are required for each method, and they are outlined below. For the Mailchimp instructions, look for the 'Mailchimp Setup' heading.</p>
					<p>The email subscription form (in the index.html file) has the following structure:
					<pre>&lt;div class=&quot;email-subscribe&quot;&gt;<br>	&lt;form id=&quot;newsletter-signup&quot; action=&quot;php/subscribe.php?action=signup&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;<br>	&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; class=&quot;enteremail&quot; name=&quot;signup-email&quot; id=&quot;signup-button&quot; placeholder=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;<br>	&lt;button type="submit" id="signup-button" class="signup-button"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-check"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;<br>	&lt;div id=&quot;signup-response&quot; class=&quot;response&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>	&lt;/form&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
					The same form on the standard index.html file (does not actually save the addresses) looks the same, but does not have the names, IDs and actions required for the AJAX form. Anyway, you can customise both versions very simply. If you want to change the placeholder text value for where email addresses are entered, change the following code: <code>placeholder="YOUR PLACEHOLDER TEXT HERE"</code>. Note that there is not a value for the submit button - instead a Font Awesome icon is used.</p>
					<p><h3>MySQL / Send to Email Instructions</h3>
					Once again, I won't go into extensive detail about how the subscribe.php file works. You can choose whether subscribed email addresses are saved to a MySQL database when submitted, and/or sent in an email to you. It is easy to select which (or both) of these methods you use - see later on in this section.</p>
					<p>When the form is submitted, it is sent to the PHP through JS which validates the data, generates the response messages (such as 'Nothing Entered!'), and finally sends the messages back to the page (through JS), so the page doesn't need to be refreshed. As usual, there are comments throughout most of the PHP explaining what it does and how it works, although a majority of the PHP doesn't need any customisation.</p>
					<p>Obviously, some details such as MySQL usernames and passwords along with your email address (for addresses to be sent to) are required for parts of the script to work, and you may want to customise other variables such as the response messages. Therefore, these details are easily accessible at the top of the subscribe.php file. All of the information is contained in variables, just swap the default information for the correct information for your servers, and feel free to change the response messages. This is the block of code you are looking for:
					
					<p>As mentioned earlier, you can set up the PHP to either save the addresses into a MySQL database, or send them to you via email, or both. If you want the PHP to save to MySQL, set the $saveToMySQL variable to 'true', and if you don't want them saved to MySQL, set this variable to 'false'. Similarly, if you want to enable email notifications set the $sendToEmail variable to 'true' or 'false' if you don't require this feature. Follow the steps below to add in your settings for both features. </p>
					<p>You can use both methods at once - i.e. the address will be saved to your MySQL database and you'll also get an email containing it. If you set them both to 'false', the form won't do anything, so you could use this to make it run your own functions (see below).</p>
					<p>To allow the form to submit addresses to your MySQL database, firstly make sure the $saveToMyQL variable is set to 'true'. You'll also need a database (named whatever you like) and a table within that database (which you can also name whatever you like,
					
					a good example is 'signups'). You'll also need to put some columns inside this table. For this script, you'll need three columns:
					<ol>
					<li>The first one contains the email addresses, and is called: <b>signup_email_address</b>, is type <b>VARCHAR</b> and set a length of around <b>200</b>.</li>
					<li>The second column records the date of when someone signed up, and is called: <b>signup_date</b>. Again, set it to <b>VARCHAR</b> and set a length of around <b>200</b>.</li>
					<li>The third column is similar to the second, but contains the specific time of signup. It's called: <b>signup_time</b>. Again, set it to <b>VARCHAR</b> and set a length of around <b>200</b>.</li>
					</ol>
					
					A good way to manage your MySQL database is with PHP MyAdmin (you can find a decent tutorial <a href="http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin_create_database.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).
					Check with your hosting company whether you have PHP MyAdmin installed (if there are other ways to manage MySQL), and make sure you know your username and password information.
					Fill in your connection and database information in the settings block of code entitled MySQL Connection Settings.</p>
					<p>If everything is set up correctly, when you (or a user) tests the form, you should find that their email address (along with the date and time they subscribed) stored in your table in the database.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, as mentioned above, you can have the submitted email addresses sent to you via email, which can be used either as an alternative to MySQL storage (if you do not have a database, for example), or as a way of notifying you that someone new has signed up, but the data is still stored in the database. To set this up, make sure the $sendToEmail variable is set to 'true', and then in the Email Notification Settings type in the email address your want the notification emails to be sent to. If you wish, you can customise the 'From' header of the email (i.e. when you receive the email, you'll see it's from whatever you type here). It's best to keep it in the given format, with a name of your choice then the email address it's being sent from. If everything is set up properly, when someone subscribes you'll get an email containing their email address.</p>
					<p>If you're fairly confident with PHP and MySQL, you could easily stop the form storing addresses in MySQL and have it do something else with them, such as save them in a .txt file or email them to you. If you don't want it to save them to MySQL as is set up here, either use the plain HTML version of this theme and start from scratch or remove the following line in the PHP code, and replace it with PHP do do what you want with the addresses. It has to be in that particular place in the script, as that is the point where there are no errors.
					<pre>$insertEmail = mysql_query(&quot;INSERT INTO $mysql_table (signup_email_address, signup_date, signup_time) VALUES ('$email','$date','$time')&quot;);</pre>Note that the <code>$insertEmail</code> variable is used for validation - i.e. if the data cannot be stored in the database for an unknown reason (such as incorrect passwords) an error response will be generated. So make sure you include some kind of validation with your custom script so users know if it hasn't worked.</p>
					<p>Also, note that if the loading image shows for a very long time in the form, it most likely means something is incorrect which is stopping the PHP script from working.</p>
					
					<p><h3>Mailchimp Setup</h3>
					Either as an alternative or as well as  using email notifications or MySQL as explained above, you can also use <a href="http://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> integration. This means that when a user subscribes, their email address is automatically added to your List of subscribers on MailChimp, so all of the addresses are there ready and waiting for you to contact them. Using MailChimp helps to simplify the whole process of subscribing, managing and emailing your users. Following is the step-by-step guide for integrating MailChimp with this under construction theme.</p>
					<p>If you want to enable MailChimp integration for the theme, you'll need to set the '$mailChimpList' variable to 'true', at the top of subscribe.php.</p>
					<p><b>Step 1 - Make a MailChimp Account</b><br />
					If you don't already have an account, go to <a href="https://login.mailchimp.com/signup" target="_blank">login.mailchimp.com/signup</a> and enter your details. You'll then be prompted to enter more specific details about your company in order to comply with various rules and regulations about emails.</p>
					
					<p><b>Step 2 - Create a List</b><br />If you already have a list set up, skip this step. Otherwise, on your MailChimp <a href="https://us7.admin.mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> click on 'Lists' in the left hand navigation panel, as shown in the image below.</p>
					<p><img src="assets/images/mailchimp1.jpg" alt="MailChimp" /></p>
					<p>Once you are on the lists page, click on the 'Create List' button in the top right hand corner of the page, as indicated by the arrow on the page itself. Type in your details such as names, subjects etc. as you want them, as explained by the page. Once you have customised this, click 'Save' at the bottom of the page. You'll be redirected to the Lists pag, where you can see your new list.</p>
					
					<p><b>Step 3 - Get List ID</b><br />In order to tell the PHP script which of your lists to add the addresses to, we need it's ID. </p>
					<p><img src="assets/images/mailchimp2.png" alt="MailChimp" /></p>
					<p>On the Lists page, click on the dropdown menu then on 'Settings' as shown by the image above.</p>
					<p>At the very bottom of the List Settings page, you'll see a small section which shows the Unique ID for this list, as shown by the image below.</p>
					<p><img src="assets/images/mailchimp3.jpg" alt="MailChimp" /></p>
					<p>Copy that ID code, and paste it into the space in subscribe.php, where it says LIST ID HERE.</p>
					<pre>/* === MailChimp Configuration and Settings === */<br>// Change these details according to information available from your MailChimp account<br />// Enter your MailChimp API Key - see http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api<br><br>$apikey = 'API KEY HERE';
					<br />// List ID is required in order to decide which of your lists to subscribe users to. This can be found by loggin into your MailChimp account and by going to Lists --> List Tools, and List ID entry at bottom of page. See Documentation for more info<br><br>$listId = 'LIST ID HERE';</pre>
					<p><b>Step 4 - Get your API Key</b><br />You'll also need a unique API key in order to integrate MailChimp.</p>
					<p>To get it, go to this page: <a href="http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api" target="_blank">admin.mailchimp.com/account/api</a> and click the 'Create A Key' button. Your new API Key will appear in a table below, and simply copy the API Key from the text box, and again paste it into the space 'API KEY HERE' in subscribe.php, as demonstrated above.</p>
					<p>You should now have integrated MailChimp! Test it out yourself to see if it works. It's also worth noting that when a user subscribes using MailChimp, they won't show up on your list of subscribers until they have confirmed their subscription by clicking on a link automatically sent to their email address.</p>
